/*
 * Goal: Map the same memory twice to different, contiguous virtual addresses
 * within the process's address space.
 *
 * One technique, which works on both Linux and FreeBSD, is to create a shared
 * memory object (referenced as fd) and mmap() the object twice at contiguous
 * addresses. One can use either shm_open() (POSIX) or memfd_create() (GNU) to
 * create the shared memory object. (FreeBSD provides memfd_create() since
 * FreeBSD 13.0.)
